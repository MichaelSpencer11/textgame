# TextGame
What's up yall. Thanks for coming to my project. I started this project a year ago to just have fun coding something for myself.
Now I am ready to invite others to share in my project. It doesn't have a name yet, I don't think.

It is coded 100% in vanilla Java. Mmm that sounds delicious. It is. Java is really fun to program in because of the Java Virtual Machine!
It can run Java anywhere, even on something without a screen! Isn't that pretty interesting?

Here are some tools and technologies that will help you if you want to interact in some way. They are the ones I use for this.
Java //the programming language
Eclipse IDE //the program to use to code ...another program lol
Git/Github  //version control software...save your game to the cloud!
Object Oriented Programming //need to know this concept and all its child concepts

Google and Bing are your friends.

Future plans:
port to ASP.NET CORE and C# just to see if we can
use ASP.NET CORE MVC, a relational database, and Vue.js //to make it live on the internet 

Sincerely Yours,
Michael Spencer
